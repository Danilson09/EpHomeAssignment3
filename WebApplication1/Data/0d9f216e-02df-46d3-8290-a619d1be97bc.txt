app layer
transport layer
internet layer- ip and icmp(sends error msgs)
network access layer- has data link and physical

osi model

app layers - user interface
presentation layer- presents data,handles proccesses(encryption)
session- seperates app data

transport - provides delivery,error correction before retransmit
network- logic adressing for routers for path determination ip
data link- combines packats into bytes and bytes into frames
-provides access to media using mac
- performs error detection

physical- moves bits between devices
specifies voltage,wire speed
define how data transfers through wires
determine how to rebuild data stream

tcp handshake
udp connectionless
